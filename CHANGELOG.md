- An endpoint to the Ironic mock to make it work with the flocx provider API
- Schema validation for provider offer objects

### Changed

- The flocx.py service into two separate services for each of the flocx API's
- The "Create offer" modal to reflect the flocx service API changes
- The "Create offer" modal so that the start and end dates and times are on the same line

## [1.0.2] - 2019-08-07

### Added

- Ironic service and REST API endpoints
- Additional comments where necessary
- "Displaying X items" text at the bottom of data tables
- A modal to create offers from existing nodes
- A date filter to make using dates in the UI and throughout the application much simpler
- Constants for certain values to allow easy customization
- A detailed node list controller that merges data from Ironic with data from the flocx-market

### Changed

- Flocx service to handle incoming data in the form of bytes instead of as already decoded JSON
- Now uses a node list merged with existing offers instead of using a separate offer list
- Test coverage thresholds to be 30% from 50%
- Certain API paths to have a final '/' at the end where there was not one previously

- Developer documentation to reflect the API changes from a mock backend to using the flocx-market directly

### Removed
